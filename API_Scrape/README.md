# Imports
### Requests:
This is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests. It’s used here to get data from the web API.
### xlwt and Workbook:
These come from the xlwt library, which is used for creating Excel files (.xls format). The Workbook is essentially a container for the spreadsheet.
### email.mime.application, MIMEMultipart, MIMEText, etc.:
These classes are from Python’s email module and are used to construct and format the content of the email, including the body text and any file attachments.
### Smtplib: 
This is Python’s built-in library for sending emails via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). It handles the actual sending of the email once it's constructed.
#### os.path.basename:
This is used to extract the filename from the file path when attaching files to an email.

# Constants
### URL:
This is the API endpoint for scraping job postings from RemoteOK, a remote job board. The data will be returned in JSON format.
### USER_AGENT:
This string is used to mimic a browser when making a request to the server. Websites often check the User-Agent to verify that the request is coming from a browser and not a script, which helps avoid blocks from scraping.
### REQUEST_HEADER:
This is a dictionary containing the headers for the HTTP request, including the User-Agent and language preferences.

# Function
### get_job_posting()
- Purpose: Fetches job posting data from the API.
- Details: It sends an HTTP GET request to the URL using the specified headers (including the User-Agent to avoid blocks).
The API returns data in JSON format, which is then converted into a Python object (usually a list of dictionaries).
Returns: The JSON response from the server.

### output_jobs_to_xls(data)
- Purpose: Converts the job data into an Excel file (.xls).
- Details: It first creates a new Excel workbook using Workbook().Then it adds a sheet named 'Jobs' to store the data.
The first row of the sheet contains headers, which are taken from the keys of the first job entry in the dataset (since the API likely returns a list of dictionaries).
It loops through the list of jobs, extracting their values and writing them row by row to the Excel sheet.
Finally, the workbook is saved as remote.xls.
This function essentially creates a table of job data with column headers for each field (like job title, company, etc.).

### send_email(send_from, send_to, subject, text, files=None)
- Purpose: Sends an email with or without file attachments.
- Details: The function constructs an email message using MIMEMultipart, which allows combining multiple parts (like text and attachments).
The msg object includes basic email headers like the sender (FROM), recipient(s) (To), subject, and date.
The text content of the email (specified by the text parameter) is attached as a plain-text message using MIMEText.
If there are files to be attached, it loops through them, opens them in binary mode ('rb'), reads the content, and attaches them to the email as MIMEApplication objects. It sets the appropriate headers for the attachments, including the file name.The function sets up an SMTP connection, logs in to the SMTP server (though the actual server and credentials are missing in this code), and sends the email.
Note: The code has placeholders for the SMTP server address and credentials, which would need to be filled in for it to work.

# Main Execution Block

'''

if __name__ == "__main__":
    json = get_job_posting()[1:] # Get the data from website starting from index 1.
    output_jobs_to_xls(json) # Save the data into xls format.
    send_email('send_from', ['send_to'], 'Subject',
               'Text', files=['File name']) # Send the data to email.
               
'''

- The script is designed to execute when run directly. Here's what happens step-by-step:
1. Fetch Data: It calls get_job_posting() to get the job postings from the API, and slices the list to skip the first entry ([1:]). This might be because the first item in the API response is either metadata or not needed.
2. Write Data to Excel: The data (JSON) is passed to output_jobs_to_xls(), which writes the job postings into an Excel file (remote.xls).
3. Send Email: After the file is generated, send_email() is called. The email will have a subject and text body, and it will attach the newly created Excel file. The sender and recipient details are placeholders ('send_from', 'send_to') and need to be replaced with actual email addresses.
